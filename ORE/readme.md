ORE, or Online RPG Engine, is an open-source engine created in Visual Basic 6 by Aaron Perkins. Although it has never officially been claimed as being abandoned, ORE has not received any updates for over 2 years. 

Releases

ORE v0.4.0

The first version of ORE publicly released, ORE 0.4.0, gained its publicity through Planet-Source-Code. Although considered an engine, it was more like an open source game due to the lack of code structure. Although very slow and primitive, it contained the absolute basics of a graphical online game such as fighting, leveling, and animations.

Each version of ORE 0.4 used DirectX7's DirectDraw for rendering and the Microsoft WinSock Control for networking. 

ORE v0.5.0

A few years after the release of ORE 0.4.0, a new version was released that contained a completely redesigned project. The code was much more structured and contained many new features including the usage of DirectX8's Direct3D for rendering and DirectPlay8 for networking. Though after releasing it, it received minimal attention from its creator.
